I worked on this assignment alongside @skang42 to implement Problem 2, Review Problem 1, and Test Problem 3.

As an implementer, I worked over different ways to go about the play method alongside Sullan, from template, and abstract class, to extra implementing. (https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/issues/2) + (https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/issues/3) Eventually we merged our work to master (!4)

As a reviewr, we went over the conceptrs done for Problem 1, and ended up leading to the creation of an abstract class rather then a bunch of PC classes. (Same Issues as before)

As a tester, I more relied on Sullan for tests, but aided where I could and helped draw conslusions to how we could resolve these issues. (!6)
