  - [Decided](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/issues/2#note_30109) on how we would proceed forward with Problem 1 implementation to keep inheritance in mind
  - Submitted [MR](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/merge_requests/2) that dealt with implementation of the first design problem after revision
  - [Discussed](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/merge_requests/3#note_31432) utilizing the `TEMPLATE METHOD design pattern` for dealing with Playable titles
  - [Gave](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/merge_requests/2#note_31423) input on moving of `UNDEFINED` Strings into the `AbstractPlayable` and possible drawback


- Problem 2: Tester
  - [Posed](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/issues/3#note_30202) idea for how to show difference between individual Playable's silences
  - [Gave](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/issues/3#note_30466) input for utilization of `TEMPLATE METHOD design pattern`
  - [Reviewed](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/merge_requests/4#note_31434) new MR for Problem 2
  - [Gave](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a5t22/-/merge_requests/3#note_31462) input on viability of moving `setTitle` and `getTitle` to `AbstractPlayable` from a design perspective
