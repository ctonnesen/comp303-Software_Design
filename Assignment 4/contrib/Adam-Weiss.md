My first contribution was implementing a BufferDecorator as discussed in
issue 3 https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a4t11/-/commit/569b5a0fc696c49eeeaff3ac3878f929dab91c1e

My second contribution was in TestPlayList wehere  was a tester. There I used code coverage tools
as demonstrated in class to see that previously made tests only covered 70% of the methods
in Playlist. As a result I expanded the test to include ones for description and duration.

My third contribution was reviewing MR 11. Here the code that was submitted looked good, so I tried pointing out how it meshed nicely with other parts of the code.
