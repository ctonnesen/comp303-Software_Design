[Problem1]: Tester
* Checked the details of the code of initial implementation, pointed out bugs
https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a4t11/-/merge_requests/3

[Problem3]: Implementer
* Suggested using polymorphic object copying for p3, contributed a design diagram (not completed, just to clarify my idea)
https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a4t11/-/issues/4#note_21814

* Helped deciding the implementation for `Song` object
https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a4t11/-/issues/4#note_21826
