I was initially supposed to implement the first draft for PlayCountDecorator. However, someone in the team mentioned 
just a bit before I was ready to push what I worked on that they made the initial draft. I still wanted to push my version 
that I worked on and I also made a comparison between what they put and what I put in my code, we ended up going with my version 
so here I created a merge request for my version.
