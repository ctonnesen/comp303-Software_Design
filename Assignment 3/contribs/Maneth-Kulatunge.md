**Problem 1**
- Since we had passed all implementation checks, I opened and pushed for discussion on alternate design decisions that involved the flyweight pattern to increase the ability of duplication by classes such as Son
- I also pushed the discussion on the usage of default null values while supporting the usage of optional types as the default pattern

**Problem 4**
- Reviewed entire merge request and provided constructive comments and played an integral decision making role in reverting back to an initial equality detection pattern (non-enum) which allowed seamless and understandable equality detection mechanism
- Provided a skeleton testing method for the album class for future review/QA
