[Designated Roles](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t1/-/issues/2). 

### Area 1 & Area 2: Tester & Reviewer ###
1. I wrote some tests for Area 1 (MenuItem class and Menu class) in the [merge request](!21) using the skill of metaprogramming. I also found some problems in the classes which override the equals() method, so I overrided the missing hashcode() method in the same merge request.
2. I wrote some tests for Area 2(ComboMenuItem and SizedMenuITem) in the [merge request](!27) and fixed some bugs.
3. I helped to review the filter in !11 and !22.

### Area 3: Implementer ###
1. I used the Observer Pattern to implement Area 3 and added some buttons for event handling in the GUI with some skills of functional programming. [The related merge request](!6) [The related issue](#5). The user can choose several items from one ListView (by holding "Catrl")or several items from several ListViews to remove and add them as a combo!.


### Area 4: Reviewer & Partial Implementer ###
1. I helped to give some ideas of implementing Area 3 in the [discussion](#6) and reviewd it. 
2. I implemented the event handling for the toggle buttons in the [merge request](!18)


### Some reviews and discussion ###
I also helped to gave reviews many other merge requests and joined some discussions in different issues. (e.g. #11 !24 !25.....) Since they are not my main contribs, so I didn't list all of them.
